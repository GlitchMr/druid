Druid is a connection-oriented board game created by Cameron Browne.

Rules and a bit of strategy can be found at
<http://www.cameronius.com/games/druid/>.

Quick instructions on getting Druid running: you need Rakudo -- instructions
here: <http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?rakudo>. Make sure you
can run 'perl6' from anywhere -- makes things easier. Then, just type:

% perl6 druid
