Druid is a connection-oriented board game created by Cameron Browne.

Rules and a bit of strategy can be found at
<http://www.cameronius.com/games/druid/>.

Instructions on getting Druid running:

* Get Rakudo.
* Set some environment variables.
* Call 'perl6 druid'.

There's also a an installer called 'proto' that you can use to install druid;
see 'Installing via proto' below.

== Get Rakudo

You need Rakudo to run the Perl 6 code in Druid -- instructions
here: <http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?rakudo>.

== Set some environment variables

Put something like this in your ~/.bash_profile analogue:

 export PERL6LIB=/your/path/to/druid/lib
 export PARROT_DIR=/your/path/to/parrot
 alias perl6="$PARROT_DIR/languages/perl6/perl6"

Remember to start a new bash process (terminal window, tab, whatever) or to
re-source ~/.bash_profile:

% . ~/.bash_profile

== Call 'perl6 druid'

Yup, you're ready to go.

% perl6 druid
% perl6 druid --size=10 --computer=1
% perl6 druid --help

== For those who want to compile things

(After all, compilation does make startup a little faster.)

% perl Makefile.PL
% make

Remember that you still need to set $PERL6LIB and $PARROT_DIR as above. The
file Makefile.PL will complain if you don't. The 'make' process, should you
foolishly proceed to it without heeding Makefile.PL's advice, will not
complain, just fail.

== Installing via proto

Proto is a no-fuss installer of Perl 6 projects. One of the advantages of this
way of installing Druid is that if you don't already have Rakudo Perl 6, proto
installs it for you.

1. Get proto from <https://github.com/masak/proto>
2. Run './proto' and optionally review the settings in the created config file
3. Run './proto install druid'
4. 'export PERL6LIB=`pwd`/projects/druid/lib'
5. 'cd projects/druid'

...and you're ready to run. See "Call 'perl6 druid'" above.

== Future plans

* Add an SVG renderer.

* Work on the machine play. (It's currently random, but I have some fairly
  nice ideas lying around in a local branch.)
